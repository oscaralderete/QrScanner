# React Native Qr and barcode scanner
Some time ago I was requested to develop a mobile app for a company, between other functionalities this app should read QRs and send it to an external API. My proposal consisted to develop a mobile app with React Native, sadly they rejected mine for another one planned to be developed with Ionic (I must to say that my proposal was rejected not because of React Native but my comparatively higher rate!).

After some months, actually past July, this guys call me for support because its new app was having some problems and it looks like their developer wasn't capable to solve that!

I tried to help them, but I'm not an Ionic expert, so after some unsuccessfully tries I quit. Then I had an idea, how much time require to develop a simple app to read QR and other codebars? actually it tooke me some 6 or 7 hours (2 hours by week during August) most of them styling: logo, layout, colors, sizes, etc. It was a really nigthmare because I consider myself a coder not a designer, but here's the result!

It won't the first prize in a beauty contest but this isn't ugly at all, it's functional and easy to use, based on the modern Expo barcode reader (Ionic still uses the antique Cordova QR reader plugin!) has support for storing, give you the type of barcode, the content, you can open URIs is that's the case and copy the content to the clipboard. If you need an app that will require an scanner, this is a really good starting point.
